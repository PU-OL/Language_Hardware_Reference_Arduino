cd "C:\Users\YOUR-USERNAME\...\Langauge_Hardware_Reference_Arduino" 

# Add style to your reference as html you generated before

## How to edit the markdown or the style

> [!WARNING]
> Editing the style file could cause multiple style and console errors
> Editing the markdown files is allowed as long as it does not violate the license
>

### I. Editing the markdown files

For editing the markdown files you need an editor like VS Code or the basic editor from windows. All Markdown files you can find in the folder markdownfiles.

### II. Editing the style

> [!NOTE]
> For editing the styles you need CSS and JS. If you are not familiar with these languages it should be avoided to edit the style.
>

For editing you have to distinguish between the style it self via the style sheet in ``../designfiles/pdfstyle.pdf`` and the file, which you can find in ``../fileforprint/addstyle.js`` for automatic add the style to the generated html file. This files have some comments but no fully documentation.
